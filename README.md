# hubbub-a-loosh

*What the heckbiscuit is this?* 
This is a python flask websub hub.

This websubhub passes the [websub.rocks](http://websub.rocks) tests for hubs. In order to use this, you will need to change any explicit references to a web address to your own personal domain. I'll factor these into a config in the future.
